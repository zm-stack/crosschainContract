/*Unified Interface for Cross-chain Trades, Swaps and Staking

You can create, buy, sell and auctions NFTs on not just Volt, but also other blockchain ecosystems.



Delivering Fair Value to Creators and Buyers Alike

You can create, buy, sell and auctions NFTs on not just Volt, but also other blockchain ecosystems.



Truly Decentralized Exchange Platform for On-Chain assets

Leverage the power of cross chain consensus, where tokens can be traded across different blockchains without the requirement of an intermediary



Volt Network has been poised to challenge the existing fast blockchain which claims to establish very high transaction

speed and throughput but they compromise on the most important aspect of blockchain, i.e. decentralization.

Volt, through its efficient core team has been working on a specific consensus mechanism known as Polysharding

which will not only increase the transaction throughput, composability and interoperability of blockchain but also keep

the decentralization intact.



To provide every individual with unrestricted access to the latest in innovation while also enabling affordability,

and financial independence.

We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities, irrespective of their region, beliefs, or economic stature.

While DeFi as a concept has displayed potential to transcend socio-economic and geopolitical barriers, it hasn’t yet

turned into a reality as there are several challenges to overcome in this relatively new technology.



As change makers, we envision ourselves as a significant contributor to a collective, on-going community effort that

will turn a remotely possible concept into reality through continuous incremental innovations and ideas.



Features of Volt DeX:



- A dependable, reliable and secure platform that flexible, friendly and secure.



- User Friendly

An extremely friendly interface with CeX like features on a completely decentralized platform.



- Chain Agnostic Scalable Blockchain

Volt blockchain is highly scalable, secure and compatible with other blockchains and charges a fraction of a fee which is even lower than layer 2 solutions.



- Negligible Fees

Don’t let gas fees bother you anymore. Unlimited trades at negligible rates. With $V, pay even less



- Synthetics Trading

Users can stake their tokens to Volt DEX liquidity pools and garner Volt tokens



- Smart Contracts

Everything will be coded into a smart contract for streamlining the functionality of the Volt chain. The smart contracts will power DeFi, NFTs and DeX.



- One Dashboard

Trade from any market on the blockchain from a single interface. Discover high-yield pools, arbitrage opportunities across protocols.



Special Perks of Volt Network

Allows to vet tokens individually and ensures that these comply with regulations before listing them Single Window Staking

Using a consensus mechanism to ensure all transactions are verified and earn rewards against staking



Unified NFT Marketplace

Extending the powers of Volt DeX to the NFT space. Discover, Mint, Bid, Buy, Sell NFTs across blockchains
